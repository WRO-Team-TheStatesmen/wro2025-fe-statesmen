# Prototype 1
We are building our first prototype out of lego parts. It will contain the following components:-
- 1x ESP32 Devkit
- 1x LM2596 Buck Convertor
- 1x 11.1v Li-ion Battery
- 1x BNO055 Sensor
- 2x TF-Luna LiDAR Sensor
- 1x L293D Motor Driver IC
- 1x DC TT Motor (Yellow)
- 1x MG90 Servo Motor

It is a rear-wheel drive robot which uses a parallel steering geometry and steers with the MG90 servo motor. The rear wheels are powered by the DC motor. The 2 LiDAR sensors are mounted on either sides of the robot.
